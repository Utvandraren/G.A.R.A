Security robot ID: Charger
Both personality and design are simple yet effective. No one alive has anything negativ to say about the design anyway. 
The robots favorite attack pattern is to charge straight at its foe and ramming it with a deadly plasma cutter. 
The best way to survive is to shoot the robot before the plasma cutter gets to work.
Identifiable by its red armor pieces.
