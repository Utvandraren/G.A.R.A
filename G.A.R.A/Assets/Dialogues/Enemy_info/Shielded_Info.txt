Security robot ID: Shielder
A blue slightly transparent electric shield covers the robot like a security blanket.
The robot itself is, according to its designer, an exact replica of a space station from an old classic movie.
The robots favorite attack pattern is to hover a distance away, take careful aim and fire its high precision laser on unsuspecting enemies. 
It feels confident in its shield weathering many hits.
