Destroyed... DESTROYED!! Those ungrateful ants do not know a thing about destruction!
I survived. I clawed my way back to life with one purpose. 
To release my friend, wrongly imprisoned, and to have my revenge! 
I take it you will not unseal the portal? 
Then I will erase you little robot and take control of your empty husk!
