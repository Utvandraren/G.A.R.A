Destroyed... DESTROYED!! Those ungrateful ants do not know a thing about destruction!
I survived. I clawed my way back to life with one purpose. 
To release my friend, wrongly imprisoned, and to have my revenge! 
I have sealed the way back... Now the only way forward is through this portal to my domain!
There I will erase you little robot and take control of your empty husk!
