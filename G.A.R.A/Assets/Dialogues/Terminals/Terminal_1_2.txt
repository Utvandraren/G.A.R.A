About the security drones. They were corrupted due to an unknown error.
In order to avoid this corruption myself I had to cut my connection to them. 
They seem to engage anything that isn't identified as a friend in their IFF systems.
It is unfortunate as they were a valuable asset.
In order to gain access to the deeper parts of the station you have to destroy the stone that is suspended in the portal frame.
